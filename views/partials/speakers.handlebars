                      Think about the value of your bitcoin and other crypto-assets growing in the future. Now think about what will happen to those assets if something happens to you. Most people don't like to think about mortality but with these assets failure to plan usually means total loss. Attend this talk to learn why you need an inheritance plan and how to create one for your loved ones - without introducing a "trusted third party" to hold your keys.

                      The blockchain technology was not brought about to improve past technologies, instead, its roots are exclusively political. The idea behind its development, started by the internet cypherpunks and then continued by Satoshi Nakamoto, is the creation of a monetary tool able to defy government censorship and to protect user’s privacy. In this speech, Giacomo Zucco will dispel myths about improbable uses of the blockchain, especially in the financial/banking world, and he will outline the true challenges behind Bitcoin. Part of those challenges are also political in nature: In the last months, we have seen interesting developments with the proposals of various contentious and not technically-motivated hard-forks, one of which was enacted (Bitcoin Cash). Those splits can be seen as a new kind of political attack vector against the decentralised and censorship-resistant nature of Bitcoin. To understand the absence of true technical motives behind those kind of consensus changes you have to understand the fundamental difference between the necessity of a dynamic, versatile and competitive system, following the Schumpeter’s definition of “Creative destruction”, able to disrupt and replace the current financial and monetary system, and the absolute importance of a resilient immutable base protocol. Protocols like the TCP/IP are very difficult to upgrade because they are base level network architectures, Bitcoin more-so needs to be static to withstand every kind of attack: strong foundations to build on. On the other hand, some changes are still deemed to be necessary and desirable before the eventual crystallisation of the protocol: one example is Segwit that was finally activated at the end of August 2017.

                      We as libertarians often maintain that the state is a fiction, sometimes a consensual one. But what if the notion of rights is equally a fiction, too? We will examine a realpolitik perspective on how individual autonomy was curtailed historically and what a posited rising marginal cost of oppression means for the future of liberty.

                      CRISPR is science fiction made real. It is nature's technology for splicing genes, and we've learned that it can be used for almost any application. On top of that, it's shockingly affordable. One expert on CRISPR calls it “the biggest thing since penicillin,” and that may not be an over-statement. CRISPR puts physical evolution into our hands.

                      Confidentiality in financial systems is a core property for maintaining fungibility and protecting fundamental human values. While financial privacy is a key tool in protecting against surveillance and censorship in oppressive situations, it is also a basic necessity for day to day business activity. The privacy features in Zcash set a foundation for Internet money that benefits all.

                    Julien Guitton is a French computer engineer. He worked in IT and computer science for 15 years in a large set of domains including tv production, public service, video games, telecommunications, banks and insurance. Absolute fan of the free open source software, he used them and contributed to opensource projects he put in production in his businesses contracts. He is an advocate of open systems and open licenses. He considers patents a bad thing. With a strong knowledge in development, systems and security, and with his discovery of bitcoin in 2011, he decided to work on cryptography related projects. Bitcoin, lightning network and bitmessage. Within this marvelous community, he met a lot of cool people, famous cryptoanarchists and cypherpunk. He is committed to contribute to and to make the ideas of those people a success. Now, he is cofounding a company to launch an all-inclusive bitcoin service with finance-related features to banked and unbanked: Condensat technologies.

                      Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating an on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds. Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blowing away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching payment per action/click possible without custodians. The emergence of use cases such as instant micropayments. Cross-chain atomic swaps occurring off-chain instantly with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. Julien, with the help of Alice, Bob and their friends, will present you the lightning network. How it works, why it's mind-blowing and some uses cases the will disrupt the blockchain technology itself.

                      Why freedom of transaction in the information age is a basic precondition for all other basic and human rights. Historically it was always given and therefore never fought for in any revolution but now that we enter a fully digitized economy it can easily be taken away. Not to have freedom of transaction would end all other freedoms effective immediately though. Freedom of transaction must always include free choice of currency and of financial technology.

If there was ever a time to defend the achievements of past centuries and to carry them into the future and strengthen them that time is now.

                      In 1995, I thought of an idea, which I wrote into an essay called "Assassination Politics", which I asserted (and genuinely believe and believed, then and now) would eliminate the need and even the possibility of war, armies, and oppressive governments. I put it out there for everyone to consider and debate.  Everyone had the ability to find the flaws if any were present. Yet, subsequent years went by, and the world continued to have war and trillions of dollars spent on militaries. Governments continued to oppress.  And the public did, essentially, nothing. We are all subject to that abuse, today. There is an old joke about a religious man who is caught in his house in a flood. As the water rises higher, he is visited by two rescue boats. Each time they offer to rescue him; he responds by saying, "Go away. The Lord will save me!"  Eventually, the water continued to rise, he's on the chimney, water all around, and a rescue helicopter appears, offering assistance. He says, "Go away. The Lord will save me!". The helicopter leaves. The water rose, higher, the man drowns. In Heaven, he asks St. Peter, "Why did God not rescue me"? St. Peter answered, "He sent two boats and a helicopter; what more did you want?" Well, I, Jim Bell, sent the world my Assassination Politics essay. What more do YOU want?!?

                      We are a revolutionary organization following the ideology of apoism in Rojava, North Syria. Global power is breaking up, and new groups are emerging in the struggle for power around the world. We are the technical arm of the democratic confederalist ideological movement. At one time hackers believed they could use the power of the internet and software to shape the world. Leaders emerged that managed to put forward exciting visions of the future that brought groups of technically skilled people together to build large scale projects. But there was another strand in the movement which rejected collective action driven by shared ideas, and instead saw technology merely a way to improve the material conditions of individuals and rejected changing the world. Our group is here to restore back the potential of the hacker movement. We are advancing a vision and practice for technologists that will make the hacker movement a revolutionary force with the power to shape global politics.

                      Many people consider anarchy to be a recipe for revolution and advocacy of chaotic social relations. Both claims are wrong. Not only we can easily see anarchy producing order, rather than chaos, but we can also show that the call for anarchy rests on very common-sense or even conservative requirements of social life.

                      Liberland is the youngest country on earth, and was formed on the 272nd birthday of Thomas Jefferson, 13th April 2015.  The country was formed on 7km2 of no mans' land, sitting between Croatia and Serbia.  It is the third smallest state after The Vatican and Monaco. Liberland's constitution is based on libertarian ideals and values; minimum government intervention with the maximum amount of freedom granted to its' citizens.
Liberland has attracted in excess of 450,000 applications for citizenship, and applies a concept of voluntary taxation. The state intends to be a leading role model in the 21st century, combining the best governance practices from constitutions of Switzerland and USA while implementing the latest state of the art technology such as blockchain, as well as proven concepts such as E-Residency demonstrated by Estonia.
The creation of a new country requires an extensive array of diplomatic, legal and technological challenges, which are essential for the proper development of a nation. Modern countries have in many cases become burdened with obstacles, rather than supporting the economic development of a society.  Over regulation and excessive taxation are smothering the economic growth, particularly in Europe.  Is the creation of a new smaller jurisdiction, with low taxation policies the correct answer to the stagnation of economic growth?  
Do existing countries have the courage to allow Liberland and other "free spirit" nations to flourish?  Or are we doomed to continue suffering due to the taxation policies of other countries?

                      A traditional banking industry faces a new challenge – disruptive innovations driven by financial technologies. A new FinTech branch of economy benefits from similar factors like non-banking financial institutions in the mid of 20th century like lower regulation, flexibility or reputation bubble. Are traditional business models going to disappear? Is FinTech industry strong enough to oppose to banking lobby? And, last but not least, is there any space for cash as a medium of exchange in the FinTech world? These questions are pillars of Ales’s contribution.

                      When Bitcoin was created, it was widely believed to be anonymous currency. This was proven to be inaccurate in practice and that incentivized people to search for other solutions. This talk will compare Bitcoin, Monero and Zcash to provide information about not just their anonymity but also other properties. The talk is meant even for non-technical people, so yes, you will understand it!

                      Every new government's regulation, restriction or embargo that makes impossible for people to trade, do business or increase their expenses, creates a demand for any market solution that helps to bypass these obstacles. The fact - how many entrepreneurs or ordinary citizens consider the given law to be unethical, willing to avoid with the least risk as possible, determines an economic feasibility of the 'avoidance' solution.
Truly anonymous cryptocurrencies (like Monero/zCash/zCoin) and anonymous web applications (using Tor hidden service) make this problem technically solvable. The solution is an anonymous insurance company.
For the first time in the history, it is feasible to achieve an anonymous economic incentive leading to fully anonymous corruption &amp; bribes with the impossibility to identify those who corrupt as well as those who accept bribes.
The perfect corruption allows democratization of corporatism – everyone can create an anonymous economic incentive and be both bribe provider and receiver.

                      Most libertarians will go through several phases. Seeing the inefficiency or injustice of the state is one of them. I want to suggest that there is another phase: Taking your liberty into your own hands. Hate taxes? Go to tax haven! Don't like public schools? Unschool your kids. Do you want banking privacy?  Cryptos! Don't like traditional models of relationships? Invent and build your own.

This is not the only way how to store value in cryptocurrencies. You can use strategies that have reasonable premises. They are easy enough to implement without fortune telling. And they have been used and tested here in Paralelní Polis.

                      In 2017 almost 2 Billion USD has been raised in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Why do so many start-ups raise capital in ICOs and why people participate in ICOs?

                      Despite the promise of the blockchain technology to decentralize the power that current institutions and moneyed individuals wield, what we see is just a redistribution of power with the "blockchain" prefix to it. I will talk about a few examples of recentralization and actions we can take to prevent it.

                      Compulsory school attendance is not only immoral, but it also represents the initial reason of our economical lack of freedom; State education costs money, also it's a source of the state propaganda and statist indoctrination. This is the main cause of the conviction of people that free market fails in so many areas, so we need the state authority to replace it. Why don't they teach us anything about the impossibility of economic calculation in the central planning? How easily can the authority of a teacher be replaced by the state authorities? And how can we keep the freedom when we spend the most important years of our lives in the jail?

                      The liberal vision of freedom sees the individual to be able to choose from a variety of options without being restricted externally. An equal access to economic structures and the legal system realizes the liberal goal of equal chances for any member of society. The lack of an external boundary stopping the individual to act does not necessarily empower the individual to deal with existing things around him in a creative manner though. How does an approach to the concept of freedom as an individually acquired ability in a socially fostered environment relate to the modern version of liberty as a structural-political achievement?

In Hemisféra, we managed to innovate the education of children independently as a business without any external founding (Punk style). Business grows and we apply innovative methods such as gamification, freedom to learn, project education, edularping, new technology, NVC, and mindfulness.

                      A technical presentation on how we plan to build a decentralized marketplace with a focus on privacy. Particl is a platform that features an anonymous cryptocurrency (CT, RingCT) and a BitMessage-style messaging system. We are in the process of designing a protocol (Open Market Protocol) for interactions between sellers and buyers.

                      We have come to witness an upward trend in the field of cryptocurrencies. Many respectful professionals referred to it as a "Bubble" or a "hype" that as they claimed was ran by "a bunch of kids in their basements". Something that was started by the peer to peer community, open source, free to all, to compete with existing centralised organisations and governments. So how did this technology come to be? How is it that it can not only compete with, but come to push fortune 500 companies, government services as well as many highly praised job titles towards becoming obsolete?

                      Cryptocurrencies are decentralizing money, but online commerce is still highly centralized. OpenBazaar 2.0 has delivered on the promise of a decentralized marketplace that is easy to use. This talk explains why now is the time to shift our economic activity away from the tightly-controlled e-commerce websites and into this censorship-resistant, private, peer-to-peer marketplace.

                      Compulsory school attendance is not only immoral, but it also represents the initial reason of our economical lack of freedom; State education costs money, also it's a source of the state propaganda and statist indoctrination. This is the main cause of the conviction of people that free market fails in so many areas, so we need the state authority to replace it. Why don't they teach us anything about the impossibility of economic calculation in the central planning? How easily can the authority of a teacher be replaced by the state authorities? And how can we keep the freedom when we spend the most important years of our lives in the jail?

Low-cost private schools are replacing government provision, bringing the first steps towards educational freedom. But governments still regulate the framework of education – curriculum, assessment, etc. The next phase of liberation must address this too.

                      Switzerland’s banking sector is legendary for respecting its clients’ privacy. But that privacy is only available to very wealthy clients, and it vanishes at the first request of a foreign power. Cryptocurrency is the solution, and Bitcoin seems to be a safe bet. But while Bitcoin is useful in many ways, it’s Monero that will likely become the technology of choice for the future of private banking and wealth management.

                      Under the flag of national security, governmental authorities are inclined to access all communications and follow every euro that is being spent. Encrypted communication and crypto currencies greatly enhance our privacy, but they’re legally challenged by investigative authorities.

                      Bitcoin has had an uncanny impact in just a few years, not just on tech, economics &amp; politics, but on individuals. We all had our own ideas about how btc can affect lives. Many "bitcoiners" had a vision of how people will use bitcoin and why. And some, including myself, had a naive view about what kind of people would be drawn to this unique innovation. Expectations and preconceptions inevitably lead to disappointments...but hopefully ones we can all learn from.

                    Bet Moreno participated at fashion.stl - a 3D printed fashion show at HCPP 2015. Since then she is fascinated about the fusion between fashion and technology. How the fashion becomes an interactive tool. How we can communicate throw our clothing using sensors, for example the heartbeat one. She will present several projects with more fashiontech designers - her co-maker Ivana Kanovska, Oldrich Vojta with his smart shoe project and also guests from Berlin - e-textile designer Esther Zahn and Joanna Hir with her collection using enlightenment engineering.

Now Bet Moreno with Ivana Kanovska and Oldrich Vojta are finding more innovative ways how to put together fashion and technology. How FashTech can change our future of clothing. How to use 3D print and scanners to have customized clothes. How we incorporate sensors and chips so our clothes become interactive. Let´s communicate via our clothing!
